<H2>If You are using A Virtual Machine, you can copy and paste to your other desktop, let the files get destroyed, or connect it to a backup and copy to that</H2>
<H1>Step 2. System Settings</H1>
<H2>Certain viruses can spread through computers. if you are using a computer without a VM, completely turn off internet connection to prevent malicious spreading</H2>
<H2>If you ARE using a virtual machine, to prevent it from spreading, turn off network location and shared folders, or the internet on your VM Entirely. WARNING! even if it is in a Virtual Machine, failing to take these steps will result in it spreading to ALL your computers (not just The virtual Machine</H2>
