# About

See above

Also:

This module is a copy of a very old project. You can tell how old it is by checking how the HTML is structured, among other things. My 2017 HTML was completely different from my 2019 and later HTML.

This project also has the term `SS` used a little bit. This is not the same as the Nazi `SS` I was actually completely unaware of what `SS` meant at the time. I still knew what Nazism was at that time, and I have always opposed it. I didn't actually figure out what `SS` meant until 2019. This term hasn't been replaced for historical purposes, I might change it after I archive the whole thing first.

## Inspiration

This is an older project, and it is inspiring to me. There are so many creative ideas here, I poured some of my imagination into this one back in July 2017.

***

## Use of INI files

INI files are heavily used in this project. They all serve the purpose of giving nearly every single folder/directory a Windows DLL icon, instead of it just showing up as a generic folder. These files are useless on Linux or other platforms if they don't support the Windows DLL icon library.
