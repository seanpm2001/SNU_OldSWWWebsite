<H1>Help - Uploading</H1>

<H2>If you want to be famous or you want to show your family or friends something, uploading is a good idea!</H2>
<H2>You can upload videos, pictures, blogs, links, text messages, and audio files</H2>
<H2>If you want your content to get the chance to be famous, set the privacy settings to public</H2>
<H2>If you want to keep your content private until you want someone to see it, change it to unlisted</H2>
<H2>When content is unlisted, only people with the post link are able to view it</H2>
<H2>If you don't want anybody to see it except for you, set it to private</H2>
<H2>Note: you can always change the privacy settings, even after upload</H2>
